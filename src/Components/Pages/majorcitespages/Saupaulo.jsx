                                    Expo stand services is a globally renowned exhibition stand design company in Sao Paulo. We design and construct exhibition stands that are not only eye-catching and inviting but also practical so that once visitors are inside, they understand exactly what products and services are being offered, and having the opportunity to ask questions and take away additional literature.

                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                                    As a skilled exhibition booth builder in Sao Paulo, we carefully choose the materials and themes that reflect and enhance the values of your company. A professional-looking, quality-rich stand also says something about the company exhibiting within it. Our bespoke exhibition stands can do wonders for your corporate identity.

                                    Our stands are lightweight, easy to set up and transport and are designed for short-term exhibition and trade shows, allowing you to attend shows at other locations within a couple of days. We provide turnkey services, which means that apart from designing and printing, we take care of logistics, installation/dismantling, and project management to ensure a hassle-free exhibiting experience. Therefore, no matter how many times you want to relocate your stands for different exhibitions, we are always there to help ease the transition process.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                                    As a leading exhibition stand design company in Brazil, our services are not limited to Sao Paulo, but we deliver stands in almost every major city of Brazil and other parts of the continent. One of the most popular stands we provide is modular exhibition stand, where elements can be added or taken away, allowing you to install a version of stand in venues of various sizes or ones which have different rules about the maximum build height or width.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                                    As a reliable exhibition booth builder in Brazil, we often become the project manager for the exhibition and take responsibility for gathering together all the necessary workmen and craftsmen needed for the installation. This can free up your own staff until the moment they are needed and give you peace of mind that the people in charge of putting everything together know what they are doing.
