During the BioFach Nurnberg 2024, workshops and seminars on organic food will be held under the direction of numerous speakers and exhibitors. The most prominent companies in the world and new start-ups exhibit organic food at Biofach in Nuremberg.
                                    Last year, more than 3,200 exhibitors – 275 at VIVANESS – presented their products and services and discussed the latest industry trends. In addition to making contacts with specialists from the organic food industry, the fair offers exhibitors the opportunity to expand their activities on the international stage.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                                    Latest brands can connect with a network of organic food professionals, grow their business, and be inspired by international markets and organic products. This abundance of possibilities regularly attracts suppliers, producers, partners, political representatives, dealers, NGOs, industry associations, VIPs, and new and existing customers worldwide to the joint BIOFACH and VIVANESS platform.

                                    The crux is that “organic” is far more than a simple official certification. This is to ensure a certain product quality, sustainability, and responsibility towards nature. Attendees know and believe it, too, which means like-minded people will find the perfect place to discuss the latest developments and attend over 130 individual exhibitions and presentations held over a four-day show.
                                    <br />

                                    BIOFACH 2024 will also attract a similar number of media types as in previous years. The recent exhibition brought together over 1,000 journalists and reporters, making it an ideal promotional space for companies and brands of all sizes. <br />
