                                    Dusseldorf’s “boot” is the world’s largest and most international indoor boat and water sports show. It is an annual public display that takes place every year. The visitor will be informed about the services and products related to water sports on a 220,000-square meter display space. The presentation focuses on breakthroughs and trends in particular. The motto of this fair is “participate and try,” and the possibility can be found in intricately developed theme worlds where visitors can test new products from many sectors. Sailing, motor boats, super yachts, boat equipment, diving, water tourism, trend sports, fishing, and canoeing are among the theme worlds based on the fair’s priorities.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Over 250 000 people are expected to attend Messe boot Düsseldorf 2024, a 9-day event that will provide a 360-degree presentation of yachting items and a special stage program with detailed interviews.
