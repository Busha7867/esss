                            <p className="intro-para3">The bespoke exhibition stand will be built according to your requirements for the size and layout of your stand. To protect the environment and increase your return on investment (ROI), we are happy to use items from your previous stands for your next project. We also include as many elements of your briefing as possible. Typical requirements are for a reusable, expandable, and reconfigurable rack. Many of our custom booths have been used for years and only need an occasional touch-up or new artwork to freshen up the look. Light boxes are an effective way to illuminate a non-standard exhibition stand. Tailor-made forms and displays ensure high quality and an individual display character.
                                <br />
                                We design and build bespoke exhibition stands using wood (mainly plywood, softwood, hardwood, MDF and chipboard), metal (mainly aluminum and steel), acrylic, glass and inflatable plastic. Our teams have worked with businesses of all sizes – small businesses, multinationals, marketing agencies and events organizations – to create projects tailored to each client’s needs. We can create unique wood and acrylic shapes thanks to our team of experienced carpenters and our CNC machine park. We work with your business, and its overall communications strategy during the custom exhibition stand design process to deliver a state-of-the-art, customized display. We build a bespoke  <Link to="/modular"> exhibition stand modularly </Link>by making it from aluminum extrusions. In this way, a custom exhibition stand can be easily reconfigured, expanded or reduced without radically redesigning the entire stand layout. Once you are happy with the design, we begin manufacturing, carried out in our factory by our talented team of carpenters, painters, blacksmiths, electricians and graphic designers.

                                While we can sometimes complete stand designs and cost calculations within a few days, we generally prefer to have around 2 weeks to develop a full design concept, prepare 3D visualizations and calculate costs where possible. Stand’s custom design is one of the best ways to ensure your experiential exhibit conveys your brand message. The entire design process for a custom stand includes design, manufacture, graphics, assembly, and disassembly. To make the most out of your custom exhibition stand, start the custom exhibit design process about a year in advance. From the age of six months, your design team will work out all your project details. Gilbert designers will develop a master theme or theme for your project and weave it into a custom display to say. A month of rest based on your feedback, they create the final “to-do list” and take care of the final details.</p>
