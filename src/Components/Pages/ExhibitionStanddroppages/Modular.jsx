If thereâ€™s one shows a year where you take up more space, thatâ€™s no problem. We have a wide range of modular exhibition stands, so you can launch a big show yearly without breaking the bank.</li>

                                            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i>Our portable exhibition stand consists of two or more kits connected via intelligent adaptation kits or connecting graphic boards. They are compact and easy to install, but you can use the display areas independently.</li>

                                            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i>We can also organize the transport of your bespoke modular exhibition stand to your next exhibition. Regardless of the exhibition location and stand size, we guarantee perfect brand consistency at every exhibition.</li>

                                            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i>In addition to the full modularity of the system itself, the graphics application allows you to easily and inexpensively switch graphics from one graphic to another, allowing you also to use specific graphics to make your message as relevant as possible.</li>

                                            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i>The modular portable exhibition stand is ideal for basic systems and exhibitions where you only have space. Our global partner network ensures that wherever your exhibition program takes place, your brand and budget can be there without physically transporting your stand around the world.</li>

                                            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i>As mentioned, our modular display systems can be expanded and reconfigured as needed. This makes them ideal for growing businesses and exhibitors looking to change size, layout or design.</li>
